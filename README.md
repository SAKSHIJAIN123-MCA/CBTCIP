I have successfully completed all the assigned tasks for my internship at CipherByte Technologies, a reputable and supportive company. Below are the details of the projects I worked on:

1. Personal Portfolio:
(i) Created a professional portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experience.
(ii) Designed the layout and user interface to be clean and visually appealing.
(iii) Included sections such as an about me page, a projects gallery, a resume, and contact information.

2. To-Do List Website:
(i)  Built an interactive to-do list application to help users manage their tasks efficiently.
(ii) Added features like task creation, editing, deletion, and marking tasks as complete.
(iii) Ensured data persistence so users can retain their tasks across sessions using local storage or a backend database.
